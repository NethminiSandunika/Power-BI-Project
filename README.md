***Enhancing Customer Experience and Sales Through BI: An Amazon Case Study***

**Description:**
This project explores how Business Intelligence (BI) tools and techniques can be leveraged to analyze customer behavior and improve business performance using Amazon as a case study. By examining a variety of data—such as browsing patterns, purchase frequency, customer demographics, reviews, and personalized recommendation effectiveness—Power BI visualizations provide actionable insights.

Key analyses include line charts for browsing patterns, pie charts for demographic distribution, column charts for review importance, donut charts for recommendation satisfaction, and clustered bar charts for purchase frequency. The insights drawn enable targeted marketing strategies, improved website usability, better recommendation systems, and enhanced customer satisfaction, ultimately driving sales and business growth.

The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle: [Amazon Consumer Behavior Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swathiunnikrishnan/amazon-consumer-behaviour-dataset/data).
